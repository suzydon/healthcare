# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard (Python Version)

# Project Purpose

This project simulates a realistic healthcare analytics scenario inspired by my volunteering experience at Cancer Council NSW. It aims to explore key metrics such as treatment volume, patient satisfaction, costs, and outcomes across multiple hospitals and departments.

# Use Case

This kind of data-driven dashboard is relevant for:
- Public health policy review
- Performance evaluation across departments
- Patient satisfaction and outcome tracking
- Psychological safety measurement in care teams

# Dashboard Features (via Python visualizations)
- Monthly patient volume trends
- Departmental breakdowns
- Cost distribution by treatment
- Satisfaction level heatmaps
- Readmission and insurance type distributions

# Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

#Sample Visualizations


Here are some sample visualizations from the healthcare dashboard:

#Insights I Found
- Oncology departments show lower variation in satisfaction
- Emergency departments have high volume but low average scores
- ICU costs are highly skewed, especially in winter months
- Private insurance correlates with higher treatment success rates
